Memory Card Game

The goal of this project is to use hooks and a lot of state to create a memory game. For this project, I used multiple components to bulild a game, where character cards are generated, and the goal is to click each of the character cards once without repeating. useState and useEffect were used to make this app function properly. I used custom styling for this project.
